# Programming_AT89S52_with_XbeeS2_and_RFID
- Serial programming code for the ATMEL 89S52, transmitting and receiving contiguously from Zigbee and RFID modules
- Programming LCD with AT89S52


Software used:
- Keil microvision - ATMEL family
- Proteus for simulation
- XCTU - to configure zigbees for appropriate baud rates and start,stop bits.


# STEPS
- Compile code
- To simulate on software - create a similar circuit as shown on Proteus, free versions are available, and load hex codes
   into the vehicle codes. For serial transmissions, use serial console
   
- To simulate on hardware, burn hex codes into the 3 hardware component circuits to create whole system, 
  Give input from console (XCTU) to one zigbee to test
